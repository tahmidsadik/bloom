# Bloom
### Fake social networking site for fun and profit.

### Getting Started
- clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/tahmidsadik112/bloom.git`
- `yarn install` or `npm install` whichever you prefer
- The project uses elm. It needs `elm-package` in path. If you already have it
  in path then just `elm-package install`. Otherwise you can install elm related
  stuff via yarn or npm `yarn global add elm` or `npm i -g elm`. It will put all
  the necessary elm stuff in path.
- in /etc/hosts add an entry `127.0.0.1 fireside.local`. We do this to get a
  clean domain while developing.
- Run the project with `yarn run build` or `npm run build`
- Steer your browser to `fireside.local:8080` for fun and profit.
